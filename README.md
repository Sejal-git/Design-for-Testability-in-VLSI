# ‚öôÔ∏è DFT Optimization Tool for Testability Improvement in Combinational Circuits

This project implements an algorithm to identify the **Most Qualified Nodes for Improvement in Testability (MQNI)** in combinational circuits using **SCOAP** metrics. It accepts **Verilog netlists** (e.g., ISCAS'85/89 benchmarks) and outputs suggested Design for Testability (DFT) insertions, maximizing testability with minimal area overhead.

## üß† Abstract

Fault detection in complex VLSI chips becomes increasingly costly if handled at later stages. This project introduces an algorithm that analyzes a circuit's **testability** and identifies internal nodes where **DFT insertion** will yield maximum improvement. The algorithm calculates **Controllability (CC0, CC1)** and **Observability (CO)** using the SCOAP technique, then computes a **Testability Improvement Factor (TIF)** to rank the best insertion points.

The tool is implemented in C and designed to work directly with gate-level **Verilog netlists**.
